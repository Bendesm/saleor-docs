## Key concepts

App extension allows extending different dashboard views by mounting extension iframe or by redirecting user on main App's iframe. 
This is a way for customizing and extending dashboard solutions.

## Manifest
App can have multiple extensions. The extension is added by specifying it in app's manifest. 
Below sample manifest, defines two extensions that will be attached to dashboard.

```json
{
  ...  
  "extensions": [
      {
        "label": "Create with Sample app",
        "view": "PRODUCT",
        "type": "OVERVIEW",
        "target": "CREATE",
        "openAs": "POPUP",
        "permissions": [
            "MANAGE_PRODUCTS"
        ],
        "url": "https://example.com/extension/"
      },
      {
        "label": "Create with App and redirect",
        "view": "PRODUCT",
        "type": "OVERVIEW",
        "target": "CREATE",
        "openAs": "APP_PAGE",
        "permissions": [
            "MANAGE_PRODUCTS"
        ],
        "url": "/extension/redirect"
      }
    ],
}
```

- `label` - Name which will be displayed in dashboard
- `view` - View where the given extension will be attached
- `type` - Place where the given extension will be attached
- `target` - Direct target on given view&type where extension will be attached
- `openAs` - Way of opening an extension's url. Default to `POPUP`. 
`POPUP` will mount extension in iframe view. `APP_PAGE` will redirect user to app page on dashboard side.
- `url` - iframe url that will be used. Url can start with `/` when `openAS` is set to `APP_PAGE` or manifest has defined `appUrl`. 

## Possible mounting places

Saleor requires that extension will define a proper combination of `view`, `type`, and `target`. The below table explains all possible combinations of mounting places.
